This includes those who work in the health and social care sectors as well as those critical to continuing to provide essential services such as transport, food and delivery, utilities, communications and public safety. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, schools will continue to care for the most vulnerable children. Vulnerable children include those who have a social worker and those with Education, Health and Care Plans – a legal document that describes a child’s special educational needs and the support they require.\r\n\r\nChildren who do not fall into these groups have been advised to stay at home with appropriate care to limit the spread of the virus, protect the NHS and save lives. \r\n\r\nThe DfE is working closely with colleagues across Government to ensure that all appropriate arrangements, and support, are in place for all DfE sectors – from early years and childcare to schools and children’s social care.

We will ensure students, parents and staff are kept up to date. \r\n\r\nThe advice from Public Health England is that it remains safe for small numbers of children and staff to attend schools, colleges and childcare settings.

               "details":"It is absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time, based on the best evidence available. \r\n\r\nOn 3 March, the Government launched its coronavirus (COVID-19) action plan: www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan/coronavirus-action-plan-a-guide-to-what-you-can-expect-across-the-uk. This plan has two overriding aims: to protect the NHS by building it up and flattening the curve of coronavirus cases; and to protect life by safe guarding those who are most vulnerable. \r\n\r\nSince this petition started the Government has made a number of significant announcements which are set out below. We will continue to adapt the response to follow the best scientific advice.\r\n\r\nOn 16 March Secretary of State for Health Matt Hancock announced a ‘Stay at Home’ policy. This is a social-distancing model for the general public with more home-working and less social interaction. \r\n\r\nGuidance on social distancing for everyone in the UK and protecting older people and vulnerable adults has been published on gov.uk: www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults.\r\n\r\nThis guidance is particularly important for people over 70 years old, pregnant women, and those with some health conditions. It advises on the social distancing measures we should all take to reduce our social interaction in order to reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19): \r\n\r\nAvoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These symptoms include high temperature and/or new and continuous cough\r\n\r\nAvoid non-essential use of public transport, varying your travel times to avoid rush hour, when possible\r\n\r\nWork from home, where possible. Your employer should support you to do this. Please refer to employer guidance for more information\r\n\r\nAvoid large gatherings, and gatherings in smaller public spaces such as pubs, cinemas, restaurants, theatres, bars, clubs\r\n\r\nAvoid gatherings with friends and family. Keep in touch using remote technology such as phone, internet, and social media\r\n\r\nUse telephone or online services to contact your GP or other essential services\r\n\r\nEveryone should be trying to follow these measures as much as is pragmatic. \r\n\r\nThe Government advises those who are at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures. This group includes those who are: \r\n\r\naged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions)\r\n\r\nunder 70 with an underlying health condition listed below (ie anyone instructed to get a flu jab as an adult each year on medical grounds):\r\n\r\nchronic (long-term) respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema or bronchitis \r\nchronic heart disease, such as heart failure \r\nchronic kidney disease\r\nchronic liver disease, such as hepatitis \r\nchronic neurological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), a learning disability or cerebral palsy\r\ndiabetes\r\nproblems with your spleen – for example, sickle cell disease or if you have had your spleen removed\r\na weakened immune system as the result of conditions such as HIV and AIDS, or medicines such as steroid tablets or chemotherapy \r\nbeing seriously overweight (a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above)\r\nthose who are pregnant\r\n\r\nThere are some clinical conditions which put people at even higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. The NHS in England will directly contact those who are in this category. \r\n\r\nPeople falling into this group are those who may be at particular risk due to complex health problems such as:\r\n\r\npeople who have received an organ transplant and remain on ongoing immunosuppression medication\r\n\r\npeople with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radiotherapy\r\n\r\npeople with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia who are at any stage of treatment\r\n\r\npeople with severe chest conditions such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma (requiring hospital admissions or courses of steroid tablets)\r\n\r\npeople with severe diseases of body systems, such as severe kidney disease (dialysis)\r\n\r\nThe Government will shortly start a ‘shielding’ approach for the 1.4 million most vulnerable people in our community. \r\n\r\nOn 17 March the Foreign and Commonwealth updated their travel advice, advising against all non-essential international travel, initially for a period of 30 days. This reflects the pace at which other countries are either closing their borders or implementing restrictive measures. \r\n\r\nOn 19 March the Government will introduce the Coronavirus Emergency Bill which will grant the power to keep essential services running. \r\n\r\nThese measures will be disruptive, but the Government believes they will save lives.\r\n\r\nTackling coronavirus is a national effort: thank you for the part you are playing. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care.",

               "summary":"HE providers must deliver high quality courses.\r\nIf students are unhappy they should first complain to their provider and if their concerns are unresolved they can ask OIA to consider their complaint.",
               "details":"Government recognises the challenges facing students and supports them in their desire to continue receiving the best possible learning experience from our higher education (HE) providers. We consider it in the best interests of all students that they receive a high-quality online education during this unprecedented period that allows them to progress and to complete their studies within the time period they had been anticipating.\r\n\r\nThere are some fantastic and innovative examples of high-quality online learning being delivered by HE providers across the country, and the sector is working hard to provide and prepare learning materials for the summer and autumn terms. Universities are autonomous and responsible for setting their own fees. In deciding to keep charging full fees, universities will of course want to ensure that they can continue to deliver courses which are fit for purpose and help students progress their qualifications. Any refund is a matter for universities, so we are not considering a write off of tuition fee loans.\r\n\r\nWe believe that students should be at the heart of the HE system. The Office for Students (OfS), the regulator in England, has committed to protecting students throughout the present crisis and has published guidance for registered providers on how it will approach the regulation of quality and standards, and this includes practical ways in which students can complete their studies whilst ensuring quality and standards are upheld. Providers are already making these arrangements and the Government is in continuous contact with the sector to support the continuation of teaching and assessment. The Government is also working closely with the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education to ensure students continue to leave HE with qualifications that have real value, reflect their hard work and allow people to progress. \r\n\r\nThe Government’s clear expectation is that HE providers should make all reasonable efforts to enable students to complete their studies. If providers are unable to facilitate good online tuition, they should seek to avoid charging students for any additional terms they may need to undergo as a consequence – avoiding effectively charging them twice. Whether or not an individual student is entitled to a refund of fees will depend on the specific contractual arrangements between the provider and student. \r\n\r\nIt is important that students continue to receive a good standard of education, and they are entitled to make a complaint if they feel that their HE provider has not taken sufficient steps to appropriately respond to this situation. In the first instance, students should speak to their provider to see if they can resolve their complaint. We expect student complaints and appeals processes to be operated flexibly, accessibly, and sympathetically by providers to resolve any concerns. If a student at a provider in England or Wales is not satisfied with their provider’s response, they can ask the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA) to consider their complaint. \r\n\r\nGovernment also understands that it may be difficult for some students to finish their current year of study for personal reasons, and that this will undoubtedly be a source of concern to many. Where students are unable to complete their current year of study or need to repeat a year due to compelling personal reasons, they may be eligible for an additional year of fee loan support above their standard entitlement under existing arrangements. \r\n\r\nFinally, Government appreciates the difficult situation facing students who are renting term-time accommodation. We encourage universities and private hall providers to be fair in their decisions about rent charges for this period. A number of large companies have waived rents for the summer term or released students early from their contracts. Students who are tenants with individual private landlords should discuss the possibility of an early release from their tenancy agreement. The Government has also worked with the OfS so that existing funds, totalling £46m across April and May, can now be used to boost providers’ hardship funds for students in financial difficulty. This can include help for IT equipment and internet access, and may be helpful for students who are struggling with housing costs or loss of income from part-time work.\r\n\r\nGovernment has previously responded to a petition concerning compensation for strike action at universities. The response to this petition can be found here: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/300528 \r\n\r\nDepartment for Education \r\n\r\nThis is a revised response. The Petitions Committee requested a response which more directly addressed the request of the petition.

Examples given include Mughal India 1526-1857, China’s Qing dynasty 1644-1911, changing Russian empires c.1800-1989, and the United States in the 20th century.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the local history study element within each key stage offers opportunities to teach about these areas.

By 2024 75% of women from BAME background will receive continuity of care from their midwife throughout pregnancy, labour and the postnatal period, with additional midwifery time where needed. The evidence shows that continuity of carer models helps reduce pre-term births, hospital admissions, the need for intervention during labour, and to improve women’s experience of care.  Continuity of carer can significantly improve outcomes for women and their babies from ethnic minorities and those living in deprived areas \r\n\r\nLocal Maternity Systems will receive funding and support to implement targeted and enhanced continuity of carer from 2021. In the meantime, Local Maternity Systems are rolling out a standard continuity of carer model and the NHS Planning Guidance 2019/20 stated that that they should use all reasonable endeavours to prioritise women who face the poorest outcomes, which includes BAME women.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe MTP is promoting greater service user participation in the design and delivery of maternity services through Maternity Voices Partnerships (MVPs), and is making particular efforts to ensure diverse voices are heard.  National Maternity Voices, funded by NHS England and NHS Improvement, are providing additional support for BAME parent representatives.  \r\n\r\nResponding to the Coronavirus pandemic\r\n\r\nDHSC is funding studies through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) – funded Policy Research Unit in Maternal and Neonatal Health and Care, at the University of Oxford, to identify the factors associated with the higher risk of maternal death, and more recently to provide data on the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on BAME pregnant women.\r\n\r\nThe UK Obstetric Surveillance System collects information about all pregnant women admitted to hospital who are confirmed to have the virus infection including the influence of demographic characteristics on outcomes for mother and infant. This research group published a paper in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) on 8 June 2020, Characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK: national population-based cohort study, which states that 56% pregnant women admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were from black or other ethnic minority groups. \r\n\r\nThe Chief Midwifery Officer has written to Local Maternity Systems, asking them to take specific actions which will minimise the additional risk of COVID-19 for BAME women and their babies.  These include local systems increasing support for BAME pregnant women through co-production  and implementation of an operational policy for how they will manage the risks of COVID-19 for pregnant women from a BAME background and tailored communications for pregnant BAME women with information about local services and to reassure them that maternity services are available during the pandemic, and encourage them to seek help if they have any concerns. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care\r\n",

               "summary":"Our hard-working healthcare workers do an incredible job. Many NHS staff are already benefitting from the most significant pay reforms in a decade, with similar reforms planned for other staff groups.",
               "details":"NHS staff are our greatest asset. In these most difficult of times and with ever increasing pressures on the NHS, they work incredibly hard, always putting patients first and keeping them safe whilst providing the high-quality care we all expect.\r\n\r\nThe overriding principle during this time of national emergency is to ensure NHS staff do not feel forced to work if they are unwell by ensuring they receive full pay if they contract the virus or must self-isolate, and for staff not to have to use their annual leave for any COVID-19 related absence. It is right that those who work well beyond the call of duty should be paid for every hour they work and receive premium pay rates for working unsocial hours. It is vital we care for those that we all rely on to care for us. The NHS has introduced a free-to-use staff support line and text service which all NHS staff can use for support, signposting and confidential listening from trained respondents. NHS staff have also been given free access to a series of apps to support their mental health and wellbeing.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term we are committed to ensuring that the NHS employment offer continues to attract and retain the compassionate and dedicated staff the NHS needs.\r\n\r\nThe independent Pay Review Bodies make annual recommendations on pay rises for NHS staff. The Pay Review Bodies are made up of experts and their recommendations are based on comprehensive assessment of evidence from key stakeholders, including NHS system partners and trade unions.\r\n\r\nAs part of our ambition to make the NHS the best employer in the world, the Department of Health and Social Care has reached multi-year pay and contract reform agreements with trade unions across the NHS workforce.\r\n\r\nFor Agenda for Change staff (including nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants and others) the agreement, supported by the majority of trades unions and their members, delivers pay awards and contract reforms over three years from 2018/2019 to 2020/2021. The multi-year deal is already benefiting around one million NHS staff. Over the three years:\r\n\r\nstaff below the top of their pay band will receive pay increases of at least 9%; pay for most staff at the top of their pay band will rise by 6.5%;\r\n\r\nThe reforms agreed are not just about headline pay but changes that will help improve the working lives of our dedicated staff. For example, by supporting them to maintain their physical and mental health and wellbeing and introducing policies to help support staff to balance their working lives with family and personal commitments.\r\n\r\nJunior doctors are also benefiting from a multi-year agreement (2019/20 to 2022/23) which:\r\n\r\nensures all pay scales increase by at least 8.2% over the four years; includes a new higher pay point for around 1 in 8 junior doctors to reflect their level of responsibility; increases enhancements for those working the most onerous shifts; and further strengthens safety and rest limits.\r\n\r\nOur ambition is to reach similar multi-year pay and contract reform agreements with senior medical staff to reflect their roles as leaders in our NHS and attract and retain the specialists we need.\r\n\r\nTurning to General Practice, in 2019 NHS England agreed with trade unions a five-year GP contract framework which fixed funding for the core practice contract for five years. The new contract provided funding clarity and certainty to practices and the settlement covers all aspects of practice income and expenses including practice staff pay. The full package for GP contract reform also sought to address workload by providing additional staff though the Additional Roles Reimbursement Scheme and also saw the introduction of the new state-backed scheme for GP indemnity. As self-employed contractors to the NHS, it is largely up to GP practices how they distribute pay to their employees, although salaried GPs employed within the majority of practices are expected to be on terms and conditions no less favourable than those in the salaried GP model terms and conditions including the minimum and maximum salary. Employers have the flexibility to offer enhanced terms and conditions, for example, to aid recruitment and retention. We anticipate good employers would set wage rates that reflect the skills and experience of their staff.\r\n\r\nWe know pay is not the only reason healthcare workers choose a career in the NHS. The reward package also includes a pension scheme which is one of the best available. Members of the scheme can generally expect to receive around £3 to £6 in pension benefits value for every £1 they contribute.\r\n\r\nThe NHS Long Term Plan outlines the next steps in our mission to make the NHS a world class employer and deliver the workforce the NHS needs. To deliver these commitments the interim People Plan details the vision and immediate actions to make the NHS the best place to work.  When published, the final NHS People Plan will set out the support and recognition that all NHS staff can expect to receive from their employer. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care",

               "details":"The UK government is aware that COVID-19 presents unprecedented challenges to many UK businesses. In the 11 March Budget, the Chancellor set out a £12bn package of temporary, timely and targeted measures to support public services, individuals and businesses through the economic disruption caused by COVID-19.\r\n\r\nOn 17 March the Chancellor went further and announced an unprecedented £330bn support package for businesses and workers to protect against the economic emergency caused by the coronavirus. This included the introduction of a Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme offering loans of up to £5m for SMEs through the British Business Bank, and a new lending facility from the Bank of England to help support liquidity among larger firms. The total of the available guarantees are equivalent to 15% of UK GDP. The package also included giving all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England a 100% business rates holiday for the next 12 months; and, increasing grants to small businesses eligible for Small Business Rate Relief from £3,000 to £10,000.\r\n\r\nThe 17 March announcement on business rate relief was supplemented by expanded guidance from the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government to Local Authorities administering these business rates relief:  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873622/Expanded_Retail_Discount_Guidance.pdf  The guidance indicates that a number of event venues are eligible including, live music venues, hotels, sports grounds and clubs and public halls.\r\n\r\nThe guidance is also clear that not every eligible venue can be listed. The list set of eligible venues is not intended to be exhaustive as it would be impossible to list the many and varied uses that exist within the qualifying purposes. There will also be mixed uses. However, it is intended to be a guide for authorities as to the types of uses that the Government considers for this purpose to be eligible for relief. Authorities should determine for themselves whether particular properties not listed are broadly similar in nature to those above and, if so, to consider them eligible for the relief. Conversely, properties that are not broadly similar in nature to those listed above should not be eligible for the relief.\r\n\r\nOn 20th March, the Chancellor announced further economic support for businesses, employees and individuals: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-support-for-businesses . The announcement included a new Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, VAT deferral for all businesses until the end of June, Income Tax deferral for the self-employed, changes to the Business Interruption Loan Scheme to make it more generous and further information on the previously announced grant scheme. Furthermore, the Universal Credit standard allowance and the Working Tax Credit were each raised to £1,000 per year; the minimum income floor for those who are self-employed and are affected by COVID-19 was suspended; and, income tax payments for the self-employed will be deferred until January. This is not an exhaustive list of the support measures announced by the government to date. Businesses, employees and self-employed individuals who are impacted by COVID-19 are encouraged to visit the UK government’s website for information and updates.\r\n\r\nFurther detail can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19\r\n\r\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.",

Key workers have already demonstrated remarkable commitment to keeping the public safe in the continuing fight against the virus. The Government hugely values and appreciates these vital contributions to the COVID-19 response, both in the private and public sector.\r\n\r\nKey workers deserve to be properly rewarded for the work they do. The Government has agreed specific pay and pension packages for a number of public sector workforces, including in the NHS, both to increase system capacity and recognise their work. More than one million NHS workers continue to benefit from the three-year Agenda for Change pay deal. The reforms will see the starting salary for a newly qualified nurse rise to £24,907 in 2020/21, 12.6% higher than 2017/18.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Government is supporting those at work through the package of measures it has announced to protect against the current economic emergency. This includes significant changes to the operation of statutory sick pay, universal credit, and employment and support allowance, so that people have quicker and more generous access to a support system. To support self-employed individuals affected by the coronavirus outbreak, the Government has also announced a new Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, alongside the deferral of income tax and VAT payments.\r\n\r\nThe Government is targeting support where it is most needed. A blanket tax holiday would be untargeted. Those paying higher rates of tax would receive the greatest benefit, while low-earning individuals with income below the personal allowance or the NICs primary threshold would not benefit. Furthermore, HMRC’s systems have not been designed to distinguish between key workers and non-key workers, and so the extension of this tax treatment to key workers would be vulnerable to exploitation and fraud by people who were not key workers and so not entitled to it.\r\n\r\nThe UK’s economic response to COVID-19 is one of the most generous and comprehensive in the world, and the Government is now working urgently to deliver these schemes as quickly as possible.  \r\n \r\nThe Government is also closely monitoring the impact of measures, having regard to the need to support public services, businesses, and individuals, and will continue to keep all policies under review. \r\n\r\nHM Treasury ",

               "details":"We recognise that Year 10 and 12 students due to take exams next year, and their parents, carers and teachers, are concerned about the disruption to teaching and learning caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The government is committed to doing all it can to minimise the effects of this. We will be providing further guidance and support for schools that sets out what school leaders and their staff should consider in planning and delivering their school curriculum next year, so that all pupils – particularly disadvantaged pupils – are given the support to make up for their lost time in education due to the pandemic. We have already committed over £100 million to support children in England to access remote education, including providing laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers to vulnerable and disadvantaged children. We are also working with the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) to explore how schools can best help their pupils address learning loss; this will include the EEF’s extensive, free research into the most effective ways to accelerate pupil progress.\r\n\r\nOur aim is that students due to sit exams next year should be enabled to progress successfully to the next stage of their lives, whether in education or employment. We expect exams to go ahead in 2021 and DfE has been working very closely with the qualifications regulator, Ofqual, the exam boards and groups representing teachers, schools, colleges and students to carefully consider arrangements for next year. Ofqual is planning to publish, before the end of term, proposals for consultation on a range of possible measures, with the overriding aim of ensuring that exams and other assessments are as fair as possible, taking into account any public health requirements and the wellbeing of students. Ofqual will publish its decisions as soon as possible after its consultation concludes, to allow time for schools, colleges and students to plan and prepare for next year.\r\n\r\nWe understand that this is a critical time for students who are due to take exams next year. Since 15 June, secondary schools and colleges have been able to provide some face-to-face support for Years 10 and 12, and students aged 16 to 19 in the first year of a two-year study programme. This extra support is in addition to their remote education, which will continue to be the main method of education for them this term, as only a quarter of this cohort can attend at any one time, to limit the risk of virus transmission. We have published guidance for secondary schools and further education providers, and ensured they have the flexibility to decide how they want to use face-to-face support in the best interests of their students. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Education",

If any student is affected by strike action, universities are expected to take appropriate action and consider their obligations under consumer law and students’ consumer rights.

The Office for Students (OfS) was set up to regulate the higher education sector in England, protect student rights and ensure the sector is delivering real value for money. It has provided guidance for students affected by industrial action. They expect providers to do all they can to avoid disruption for students, to abide by the conditions of registering with the OfS and to maintain the delivery of higher education.\r\n  \r\nStudents are entitled to make a complaint about the way their university handles any disruption caused by industrial action, should they feel their experience has been adversely affected. In the first instance, students should speak to their university to see if they can resolve their complaint. If this is not possible or if they are unhappy with the outcome, they can take their complaint to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA). The OIA covers student complaints concerning higher education providers in England and Wales and has published guidance on their approach to complaints and case studies indicating good practice and the type of compensation or remedial action they have previously recommended in this area. Case studies published by the OIA in 2019 indicate that financial compensation was recommended in a number of cases.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

This Government has made it our mission to protect the most vulnerable in our society, stamp out all forms of child sexual abuse offending, and support victims and survivors to rebuild their lives. \r\nThe Government will publish a paper into group-based child sexual exploitation in order to better understand the characteristics of group-based offending and help deliver justice for victims.\r\n\r\nThe paper, to be published later this year, will outline the insights gained from this work and focus on how agencies can learn lessons from the past to tackle group-based offending and safeguard vulnerable children.\r\n\r\nThe Home Office will set up an External Reference Group of experts to review the research before its publication.\r\n \r\nThe work was commissioned by the previous Home Secretary to better understand the scale and nature of group-based child sexual exploitation, including the characteristics of offenders, victims and the context in which these crimes are committed.\r\n\r\nLast September, the Government announced an additional £30 million to take down the worst offenders and safeguard victims.\r\n\r\nThe Home Office will shortly publish the first of its kind cross-government Child Sexual Abuse Strategy to improve the UK’s response to tackling this abhorrent crime.  \r\n\r\nIt will set out how we will work across all agencies – including government, law enforcement, safeguarding and industry – to stop offenders in their tracks, and to help victims and survivors rebuild their lives.\r\n\r\nHome Office\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

               "details":"The Government recognises the importance of physical activity to the nation’s health and wellbeing and is working with the gym and leisure sector to reopen facilities as soon as possible in a safe and controlled way. Government’s first priority is to ensure that Covid-19 is brought under control and that actions it takes do not undermine efforts to protect public health.\r\n\r\nGovernment is in discussions with a range of sports organisations, including the gym and leisure sector, about the actions that would need to be taken to restart grassroots sport and reopen facilities in a safe way. It has asked sport and physical activity organisations to consider what steps they would need to take, and guidance they would need to develop, to allow this to happen. This will be used to support the government’s decision-making around future public health guidelines.\r\n \r\nThis is not straightforward. There are many issues to consider, including how gyms could reopen and operate whilst meeting social distancing guidelines, how access in and out of facilities may need to be changed, whether facilities will have enough workers to operate safely and effectively, and whether people will be willing to come back to gyms if they do reopen. The Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy is also considering what guidance is needed on how workplaces can operate effectively and safely once the lockdown starts to ease.\r\n \r\nThe Government has also published updated guidance on grassroots sport which sets out information on the phased return of outdoor sport and recreation. This includes further details for members of the public on how they can take unlimited exercise outside, and on the steps that outdoor facilities need to take to re-open, should they wish to do so, from Wednesday 13 May. As part of this, people will be able to exercise outdoors one-on-one with a personal trainer, providing that social distancing is maintained.\r\n\r\nGovernment is clear that keeping people physically active is very important for a large number of reasons, including physical and mental health. However, as the government has made clear, the overwhelming priority of its plan for addressing the next phase of the virus is to keep the country safe. As such, a return to physical activity and grassroots sport, including reopening gyms and leisure centres will need to be done in a way that is: consistent with public health guidelines; minimises risk to participants and volunteer and staff; communicated clearly and consistently with guidance consistent across different sports and activities to reduce the risk of confusion; flexible so that arrangements can be altered and adapted if restrictions or public health advice is changed.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport",

               "details":"The Government recognises that organisations such as zoos, aquariums and animal welfare charities are working tirelessly during this challenging time to safeguard the health and welfare needs of animals in their care. The Government also recognises that many of these organisations in the UK, as well as providing high welfare standards for their animals, contribute significantly to both conservation work and education, helping both sustain endangered species but also teaching people about animals’ natural habitats - as well as how at risk that species may be.\r\n   \r\nAs announced by the Prime Minister on 10 June, outdoor animal attractions, including safari parks, the outdoor parts of zoos and animal attractions on farms, are now able to reopen, following strict social distancing guidelines. This includes keeping indoor exhibitions, such as reptile houses and those in aquariums, closed, and ensuring other amenities like cafes offer take-away services only.\r\n\r\nThe move follows close work by the Government with the zoo industry to ensure visitor numbers can be managed and safeguards are put in place. Allowing zoos to reopen is an integral step towards supporting an early financial recovery.\r\n\r\nThe decision to relax restrictions on these select outdoor attractions is part of the Government’s careful approach to easing the lockdown in phases, guided by the advice of scientific and medical experts and the fact the risk of transmission is much lower outdoors.\r\n\r\nA number of schemes have been made available to businesses and charities to help them during this emergency. Organisations are eligible to apply for a range of support schemes including the Job Retention Scheme, VAT deferral, Business Rates Relief, the Business Interruption Loan schemes, the option to reclaim the costs of Statutory Sick Pay and grant funding of up to £25,000.\r\n\r\nThe Government launched a Zoos Support Fund on 4 May worth £14m in direct response to the concerns raised by zoos and aquariums as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Licensed zoos or aquariums in England that are experiencing severe financial difficulties because of lost revenue can apply for a grant of up to £100,000.  The fund is intended to help zoos at immediate risk to protect the welfare of animals living on site or by rehoming.\r\n\r\nWe are aware of the concerns raised by larger zoos. Defra continues to engage with the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and Her Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) to monitor how zoos are doing.  Officials continue to meet regularly with some of the major zoos and aquariums in England to identify the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on larger organisations. This includes monitoring concerns around potential implications for animal welfare. Consideration of proposals for any longer-term support that might be needed for the sector is ongoing. With the help and support of the industry, Defra is working diligently to find the best way forward.\r\n\r\nThe importance of allowing zoos to reopen was also debated in the House of Commons on 11 June in the adjournment debate on the reopening of zoos, aquariums and wildlife sanctuaries.  The details of this debate can be seen in official records at https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2020-06-11/debates/CA7F5187-2AD7-4121-89B1-C8CC188FFE78/ZoosAquariumsAndWildlifeSanctuariesReopening\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n\r\n",

The measures announced by the Government, which are described below, addresses the concerns of the petition and ensures that household finances are being protected.\r\n\r\nThe Government will make sure it protects, as far as possible, people’s jobs and incomes. On 12 May, the Government announced a major extension to the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme which will continue to the end of October, including more flexibility and employer contributions from August as people return to work. All UK employers can apply for a grant that covers 80% of furloughed employees’ usual monthly wage costs, up to £2500 a month, plus the associated Employer National Insurance contributions and pension contributions. The first grant payments have now been paid to help support jobs that might otherwise have been lost. On Thursday 26 March the Chancellor announced a new Self-Employment Income Support Scheme to support self-employed individuals affected by coronavirus outbreak. The SEISS will provide grants to those who are self-employed, or members of partnerships, worth 80% of their trading profits/partnership trading profits, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month for 3 months.  To support those on low incomes through the outbreak the Government has announced a package of temporary welfare measures, which includes an increase in the Local Housing Allowance rates for Universal Credit and Housing Benefit claimants so that it covers the cheapest third of local rents. \r\n\r\nOn the 17 March, the Chancellor announced on behalf of the sector that banks and building societies would offer a 3-month ‘mortgage holiday’ for borrowers that are financially struggling with their repayments. Following from this, draft guidance announced by the FCA on the 22nd May included the option for individuals to extend their mortgage holiday for a further 3 months where needed. This measure has also been extended to Buy to Let landlords struggling as a result of their tenants being unable to meet their rental repayments.\r\n\r\nThe Government has implemented legislation that prevents landlords from being able to start proceedings to evict tenants for at least a 3-month period from the 26th March. This will provide reassurance that tenants will not have their homes repossessed at this difficult time. \r\n\r\nCustomers who are concerned about the current financial situation should get in touch with their lender or landlord at the earliest possible opportunity.\r\nThe Chancellor has also recently responded to a query on his official Twitter Q\u0026A regarding a rent freeze, you can find his response here https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1263808830355517441. \r\n\r\nWith regards to energy bills, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy announced on 19 March that the Government, working with Citizens Advice, Ofgem and Energy UK have secured an industry-wide agreement to a set of principles for assisting consumers through difficulties caused by Covid-19. These are to: identify and prioritise customers at risk, support customers who are impacted financially as a direct or indirect result of Covid 19, and support prepayment meter customers directly or indirectly impacted by Covid 19 to stay on supply.\r\n\r\nThe support offered will be based on the individual circumstances of the customer and the systems, processes and capability of the supply company, but could include extending discretionary or friendly credit, or sending out a pre-loaded top up card for traditional prepay customers who are unable to top up.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, we suggest self-isolating customers contact their energy supplier to find out what support will be available. If you need further advice, we suggest you contact the Citizens Advice Consumer Service (CACS), a Government funded advice service. You can find out more about CACS on website www.adviceguide.org.uk or by calling the Citizens Advice Consumer Helpline on 03454 04 05 06.\r\n\r\nWhile the government does not intend to bring in measures to freeze rent, mortgage and utility bill payments at this time, it has announced a significant range of financial measures and will continue to deliberate on how best it can support all those impacted by covid-19. These measures of cross sector support are already available to those that are financially struggling due to the effects of Covid 19 to help enable them to continue to pay their bills.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response. The Petitions Committee requested a response which more directly addressed the request of the petition.

We will also do all we can to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the higher education (HE) sector.\r\n\r\nOn 18 March, the Prime Minister and Education Secretary announced changes to the operational models of schools and colleges in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. These changes show how much we need to ratchet up social distancing measures to deal with the outbreak.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of supporting HE providers to remain open, as long as expert medical advice supports this. It is doing all it can to support the HE sector and its students, including encouraging them to make online teaching provision as widespread as possible for the summer term, in compliance with social distancing guidance.\r\n\r\nCessation of face-to-face teaching in favour of online provision is not closure. It is a move that enables compliance with social distancing guidance. We will continue to work with the sector to understand the developing range of options for distance teaching and learning and ensure that we support students where necessary.\r\n\r\nAny decision to close universities would be based on careful consideration of multiple factors. In any eventuality, a significant number of students may be care leavers, students who are estranged from their families, and international students for whom alternative accommodation is not easily available or who are not able to get home because of travel restrictions. It is essential that these students are reassured that their provider will continue to support them through these difficult and unsettling times. Students who remain in campus accommodation will also need additional support, including access to counselling and mental health advice.\r\n\r\nThe Department for Education (DfE) stands ready to support providers in any discussion that is needed to ensure that they have access to the right resources to care for students. The Chancellor has also announced a series of wider measures to support employers and employees, recognising the significant impacts caused by COVID-19.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education. \r\n",

               "details":"The law on dangerous dogs is concerned with protecting the safety of the public. The four types of dog, pit bull terrier, Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino and Fila Brasileiro are prohibited because they are types bred for fighting. The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 states that no person shall give away, breed or breed from, sell, or exchange a prohibited dog. However, the law allows a person to keep an individual dog where a court has considered that it does not present a danger to public safety. The court must consider the temperament of the dog and whether the intended keeper is a “fit and proper person” and other matters such as suitability of accommodation. Dogs placed on the Index of Exempted dogs may be kept by the owner under strict conditions, including that the dog is neutered, microchipped and kept on a lead and muzzled in public. There are currently around 3,000 dogs where a court has granted an exemption and allowed them to stay with their owner.\r\n\r\nThe Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 also makes it an offence to allow a dog of any breed or type to become dangerously out of control in any place. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment, where the offence has led to a death and 5 years imprisonment where someone is injured.\r\n\r\nEnforcers are able to take action before dog attacks happen. The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 includes specific measures to enable the police and local authorities to tackle irresponsible dog ownership before a dog attack occurs. Practitioners can intervene at an early stage to help to prevent situations involving irresponsible owners of dogs from becoming serious. \r\n\r\nThe 2014 Act includes streamlined measures to tackle anti-social behaviour, including where such behaviour involves a dog. The main tool to combat this form of irresponsible dog ownership is the Community Protection Notice (CPN). CPNs can be issued by local authority officers or the police on dog owners, or anyone temporarily in charge of a dog at the time of an incident, where dogs are behaving in an unruly way. The CPN could require the dog’s owner, or the person in charge of it, to take appropriate action to prevent a reoccurrence of the offending behaviour. To breach a CPN is a criminal offence and could lead to a significant penalty. The Government is determined to crack down on irresponsible dog ownership and to that end we are encouraging police forces across the country to use these new tools.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Defra has commissioned further research in collaboration with Middlesex University to look at responsible ownership across all breeds of dog. The research will consider different approaches and the effectiveness of current dog control measures. The research will also seek to identify and examine the factors and situations that may cause dog attacks; how to promote responsible dog ownership.  We expect to have a final report by the end of 2020.\r\n\r\nThere are no proposals to re-introduce the dog licence. The previous licensing scheme for dogs was ceased in 1988 because it was estimated that only around 40% of owners were compliant. This is similar to compliance levels in countries that still operate a dog licensing scheme.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs",

               "details":"Government recognises the challenges facing students and supports them in their desire to continue receiving the best possible learning experience from our higher education (HE) providers. We consider it in the best interests of all students that they receive a high quality online education during this unprecedented period that allows them to progress and to complete their studies within the time period they had been anticipating.\r\n\r\nThere are some fantastic and innovative examples of high-quality online learning being delivered by HE providers across the country, and the sector is working hard to provide and prepare learning materials for the summer and autumn terms. Universities are autonomous and responsible for setting their own fees. In deciding to keep charging full fees, universities will of course want to ensure that they can continue to deliver courses which are fit for purpose and help students progress their qualifications. Any refund is a matter for universities, so we are not considering a write off of tuition fee loans.\r\n\r\nWe believe that students should be at the heart of the HE system. The Office for Students (OfS), the regulator in England, has committed to protecting students throughout the present crisis and has published guidance for registered providers on how it will approach the regulation of quality and standards, and this includes practical ways in which students can complete their studies whilst ensuring quality and standards are upheld. Providers are already making these arrangements and the Government is in continuous contact with the sector to support the continuation of teaching and assessment. The Government is also working closely with the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education to ensure students continue to leave HE with qualifications that have real value, reflect their hard work and allow people to progress. \r\n\r\nThe Government’s clear expectation is that HE providers should make all reasonable efforts to enable students to complete their studies. If providers are unable to facilitate adequate online tuition, they should seek to avoid charging students for any additional terms they may need to undergo as a consequence – avoiding effectively charging them twice. Whether or not an individual student is entitled to a refund of fees will depend on the specific contractual arrangements between the provider and student. \r\n\r\nIt is important that students continue to receive a good standard of education, and they are entitled to make a complaint if they feel that their HE provider has not taken sufficient steps to appropriately respond to this situation. In the first instance, students should speak to their provider to see if they can resolve their complaint. We expect student complaints and appeals processes to be operated flexibly, accessibly, and sympathetically by providers to resolve any concerns. If a student at a provider in England or Wales is not satisfied with their provider’s response, they can ask the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA) to consider their complaint. \r\n\r\nGovernment also understands that it may be difficult for some students to finish their current year of study for personal reasons, and that this will undoubtedly be a source of concern to many. Where students are unable to complete their current year of study or need to repeat a year due to compelling personal reasons, they may be eligible for an additional year of fee loan support above their standard entitlement under existing arrangements. \r\n\r\nFinally, Government has worked with the OfS to enable providers to draw upon existing funding to increase hardship funds and support disadvantaged students impacted by COVID-19. As a result, providers will be able to use the funding, totalling £46m across April and May, towards student hardship funds and mental health support, as well as to support providers’ access and participation plans.\r\n\r\nGovernment has previously responded to a petition concerning tuition fee refunds for both COVID-19 disruption and strike action.

               "details":"We know that a cancer diagnosis is devastating to families.  That is why cancer survival is our priority made clear in the NHS Long Term Plan.\r\n\r\nTo ensure better outcomes for those affected by cancer we must focus our efforts on innovative research, and into new methods of diagnosis and treatment.    \r\n\r\nThat is why we have invested £1bn per year in health research through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). NIHR cancer research expenditure has risen from £101 million in 2010/11 to £132 million in 2018/19, the largest investment in a disease area.\r\n\r\nTessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission (TJBCM)\r\nIn May 2018 the Government announced £40 million over five years for brain tumour research as part of the TJBCM. This includes funding for childhood cancers research and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.\r\n\r\nFunding will be invested through the NIHR to support a wide range of research from early translation (experimental medicine), through clinical, and on to applied health and care research. In essence this will support the translation of laboratory discoveries into treatments and better care for patients, including children. \r\n\r\nThe Department is working actively as part of the TJBCM to improve research and care for people with brain cancer. We welcome the launch of the Tessa Jowell BRAIN MATRIX. This is an exciting new trials platform that will give people with brain cancer, including children, access to trials of treatments that are best-suited to their individual tumours. The Brain Tumour Charity is providing £2.8 million research funding for the study, which will enable doctors to treat brain tumours with drugs that are more targeted than ever before.\r\n\r\nTogether with NHS England, NHS Improvement and the National Cancer Research Institute, the Department joined the Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce recent research roundtable event to consider how the number of high-quality research applications can be increased for these difficult-to-treat cancers.\r\n\r\nAs with other Government funders of health research, the NIHR does not generally allocate funding for specific disease areas. The level of research spend in a particular area, such as childhood cancers and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, is driven by factors including scientific potential and the number and scale of successful funding applications. \r\n\r\nExperimental Cancer Medicine Centres (ECMCs)\r\nThe UK Health Departments and Cancer Research UK are jointly funding a network of eighteen ECMCs across the UK, investing a total of £36m in the third five-year period (2017-2022). This includes a Paediatric ECMC Network dedicated to early phase research on childhood cancers.\r\n\r\nCancer trials and studies\r\nThe NIHR Clinical Research Network has over 800 cancer trials and studies recruiting or in set-up. Through the Network, the proportion of patients entering cancer clinical trials and studies is more than double that in any other country for which data exists, including the United States\r\n\r\nBiomedical Research Centre (BRC)\r\nThe NIHR is funding and supporting a range of research for children with neuroblastoma. For example: the NIHR Great Ormond Street BRC is researching the use of imaging to assess the efficacy of induction chemotherapy for high-risk neuroblastoma; the NIHR Newcastle Biomedical Research Centre is studying the genetic profiles of high risk neuroblastomas to provide predictive and prognostic biomarkers for current and future targeted therapies; and the NIHR Royal Marsden Biomedical Research Centre is developing preclinical models of neuroblastoma and childhood soft tissue sarcoma cells for the development of target-driven drug treatment.\r\n\r\nIn September 2016 the Secretary of State for Health announced an £816 million investment in 20 NIHR Biomedical Research Centres for 5 years from April 2017. This funding includes the NIHR Royal Marsden/Institute of Cancer Research BRC which will focus exclusively on cancer research and will receive £43 million over five years from April 2017. Five other BRCs will have dedicated cancer research themes. The funding amount for cancer research over 5 years across all BRCs is an estimated £131 million\r\n\r\nThe NIHR is committed to the involvement, engagement and participation of children and young people in research, supporting researchers and funders, as well as empowering children and young people to lead their own journey with research.\r\n\r\nThe NIHR have many children and young people initiatives ongoing, such as:\r\n\r\nRaising awareness e.g. some Local Clinical Research Networks have set up Children and Young People's Forums to engage them in raising awareness of health research among their peers\r\n\r\nContributing to feedback. In 2018/19 over 900 children and young people (11% of respondents) gave feedback about their experience of participating in clinical research through the NIHR Research Participant Experience Survey\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care",

               "details":"It is a legal requirement for all owners to microchip their dogs, and to enter the details onto a database. British Veterinary Association (BVA) best practice is that vets should scan dogs on first presentation at their practice, and at other regular intervals including prior to euthanasia, where euthanasia is deemed the appropriate course of action by the veterinary expert. BVA’s website sets out their position on scanning: https://www.bva.co.uk/News-campaigns-and-policy/Policy/Companion-animals/Microchipping/ \r\n\r\nThe guidance includes advice on what a vet should do if the details of the person presenting the dog are different to what is recorded on the database, and what to do when stray or lost animals are brought to the practice by checking the microchipping databases in order to reunite the animal with their owner. \r\n\r\nThe Government considers that advice from BVA and RCVS (Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons) provides veterinary professionals with helpful guidance on conducting appropriate scanning and to protect the welfare of dogs. Ministers will continue to emphasise the importance of vets scanning pet animals when they are first presented to their surgery. \r\n\r\nSince 6 April 2016, all dogs in England and Wales must be microchipped and registered on an approved database by the time they are eight weeks’ old. Since we made microchipping compulsory, the number of dogs microchipped has gone up from around 58% of all dogs in 2013 to over 90% of all dogs. This means that about 8.5 million dogs in the United Kingdom are microchipped. We also advise cat owners to get their cat microchipped and it was a manifesto commitment to introduce compulsory microchipping for cats. As part of this commitment we recently completed a Call For Evidence on cat microchipping which attracted over 3,000 responses. We are in the process of analysing the responses and will publish a summary of the responses together with a way forward in due course.\r\n\r\nThe Government is also considering proposals for the scanning of dogs by vets as part of the ongoing Post Implementation Review of The Microchipping of Dogs (England) Regulations 2015.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs",

               "details":"The Covid-19 outbreak has far-reaching consequences beyond public health. The Government has therefore put in place an unprecedented package of support for individuals and households affected by the outbreak.\r\n\r\nThe assistance that the Government is providing is targeted to protect those most at financial risk due to the impact of Covid-19 on the economy. It includes a wide range of support mechanisms to protect people’s incomes during the Covid-19 outbreak. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme helps firms to continue to keep people in employment through cash grants totalling 80% of employees’ wages, up to a monthly cap of £2,500. The scheme will be open initially for at least 3 months and will be extended for longer if necessary.  Similar support is also being provided to those who are self-employed, or partners in businesses, through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme. Those eligible for this scheme can be paid grants worth 80% of their trading profits, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month.  \r\n\r\nProtections have also been put in place for homeowners and renters experiencing financial difficulty due to COVID-19. Following discussions with the industry, mortgage lenders are offering a three-month payment holiday for affected homeowners and landlords whose tenants are experiencing payment difficulty.  Through the Coronavirus Act 2020, we have legislated to delay when landlords are able to evict tenants. Landlords cannot start proceedings to evict tenants for a three month period and the court service has suspended all ongoing housing possession action for 90 days from 27 March. \r\n\r\nTo support those on low incomes through the outbreak, the Chancellor has also announced a package of temporary benefit measures. The Government has increased the standard allowance of Working Tax Credit and Universal Credit by £20 a week. There has also been an increase in the Local Housing Allowance rates for private renters claiming Universal Credit housing element or Housing Benefit so they are set at the 30th percentile of market rents. Self-employed workers whose income has been affected by Covid-19 will also see their Minimum Income Floors relaxed further, so that their Universal Credit award can be increased to reflect their lower earnings.\r\n\r\nThe Government has also moved rapidly to provide a £500 million hardship fund to local authorities in England. Our expectation is that local authorities will use the majority of this fund to provide council tax reductions to economically vulnerable people and households, with a focus on working age recipients of Council Tax Support. \r\nMany councils are also applying local level discretion in their approach to council tax collection, including the opportunity for individuals to set up flexible payment plans and suspension of enforcement action. Individuals whose income has been affected by Covid-19 can check their eligibility for Local Council Tax Support schemes or flexible approaches to payment by getting in touch with their councils. \r\nPeople who can afford to pay council tax should continue to do so to ensure that services, including social care for the elderly, can continue to be provided in these unprecedented times.  The Government does not consider that a general council tax holiday would be appropriate.\r\n\r\nFor more information about measures to support individuals and businesses affected by Covid-19, please see https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-those-affected-by-covid-19 and https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-support-for-businesses. \r\n\r\nAnd for information on measures and guidance for local government, please see https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-local-government#local-government. \r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing Communities and Local Government",

               "summary":"The Government has announced a comprehensive package of support for individuals and businesses which will directly benefit providers of childcare.",
               "details":"Hard-working parents across the country rely on childcare to help them balance their home and work commitments. We can rightly be proud of our childcare sector. 96% of childcare settings in England are now rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, an increase from 74% in 2012.\r\n\r\nDuring the current Coronavirus outbreak, the Government wants to support nurseries, pre-schools and childminders during what must be a worrying and uncertain time.\r\n\r\nWe have asked childcare providers to continue to provide care for a limited number of children - children who are vulnerable, and children whose parents are critical to the coronavirus (COVID-19) response and cannot be safely cared for at home.\r\n\r\nTo help them do this, we have taken steps to directly support childcare providers in the current crisis.\r\n\r\nWe currently fund local authorities (LAs) to pay early education providers to offer up to 30 hours of early education per week, to qualifying families, for two, three and four-year-old children. We announced on 17 March that we will continue to pay this funding to LAs, which will provide reassurance for early years settings. \r\n\r\nWe have also put in place a significant package of financial support including a business rate holiday for many private providers and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to support workers. We expect nurseries to take a reasonable and proportionate approach to parents’ fees, in light of these unprecedented circumstances, and to communicate any arrangements clearly with them\r\n\r\nFurthermore, childcare providers will benefit from the additional range of financial assistance measures we have introduced to support workers and businesses at this time.\r\n\r\nWe have announced that childcare providers will be eligible for a business rates holiday for one year. That means non-local authority providers of childcare (registered with Ofsted and providing EYFS) will pay no business rates in 2020 to 2021, from 1 April. This includes nurseries which are eligible for a charitable status relief – they will also pay no business rates at all in 2020-21 – and nurseries in receipt of small business rate relief or rural rate relief will benefit from small business grant funding of £10,000 (we also know that some settings operate from shared spaces which may now benefit from a 100% rates relief – and we strongly encourage those shared spaces to reflect any business rates saving in their rent charges).\r\n\r\nWe have also set up schemes to help employees and the self-employed, during the outbreak – which will benefit both providers and parents. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme means that for employees who are not working but kept on payroll, the Government will contribute 80% of each worker’s wages of up to £2,500, backdated to 1 March 2020. Businesses can access this scheme while continuing to be paid the early entitlements funding via local authorities. The self-employed may be eligible for taxable grants under the Government’s Coronavirus (COVID-19) Self-employment Income Support Scheme, announced on 26 March. \r\n\r\nWe thank the nurseries and other childcare providers who are working so hard to care for the children of critical workers and vulnerable children. This is a vital part of our fight against Coronavirus. In turn, we are working hard to mitigate the impacts of Coronavirus on all parts of our society. In the light of the steps we have already taken, we urge all childcare providers to be reasonable and balanced in their dealings with parents, given the great uncertainty they will be facing too.  We are keeping under very close review what further support individuals and businesses may require.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther information relating to setting closures, plus the full range of support available for workers and businesses can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures#funding\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/covid-19-support-for-businesses\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-scheme\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education\r\n",

The effect of taking a report to Parliament is to place it in the public domain, this is a statutory requirement, which can only be completed by a sitting ISC.\r\n\r\nOnce the new Committee has been re-appointed, it will be for the ISC to decide when the Russia report should be published.  Members of the ISC are appointed by Parliament having been nominated by the Prime Minister in consultation with the Leader of the Opposition.

These measures include: \r\n\r\n•\tBank of England’s Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) – providing funding to businesses to help businesses across a range of sectors to pay wages and suppliers, even while experiencing severe disruption to cashflows. \r\n\r\n•\t“Time to Pay” - HMRC is ready to help all businesses and self-employed individuals, experiencing temporary financial difficulties due to coronavirus, including “Time to Pay” arrangements, which allows the payment of taxes to be deferred. \r\n\r\n•\tCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme - launched on 20 April, this helps firms continue to keep people in employment by allowing businesses to put workers on temporary leave. The government will pay cash grants of 80% of wages up to a cap of £2,500, providing workers stay employed. The Scheme will cover the cost of wages backdated to 1 March. It was initially open for at least three months and it has now been extended to the end of June. The option remains to extend for longer if necessary. There is no limit on the amount of funding available for the scheme, and all UK-wide employers with a PAYE scheme will be eligible. Further guidance will be set out in due course. \r\n\r\n•\tCoronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme - has been created to support long-term viable small and medium sized businesses who may need to respond to cash-flow pressures by seeking additional finance. To be eligible, a business must be based in the UK and be impacted by COVID-19, have an annual turnover of no more than £45 million, and be seeking a loan up to £5 million. The scheme is delivered through commercial lenders, backed by the government-owned British Business Bank. There are more than 40 accredited lenders able to offer the scheme, including all the major banks. \r\n\r\n•\tCoronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme – all firms with a turnover of more than £45 million will now be able to apply for up to £25 million of finance, and larger firms with a turnover of more than £250 million can apply for up to £50 million. The Government will provide a guarantee to enable banks to make these loans. It will support business that were viable before the COVID-19 outbreak, which are otherwise unable to access the finance they need.\r\nAll of these measures have been designed to ensure that companies of any size receive the help they need to get through this difficult time – including airports, airlines and the wider supply chain.\r\n\r\nIf airlines or airports find themselves in trouble as a result of COVID-19 even following the Government’s cross-economy wage and financial interventions, the Transport Secretary and Chancellor have confirmed that the Government is prepared to enter discussions with individual companies seeking bespoke support as a last resort, having exhausted all other options. Any intervention would need to represent value for money for taxpayers.\r\n\r\nFurther details of all these schemes and support can be found at https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport",

The Coronavirus Act 2020 allows a suspension of the duty on parents to secure regular school attendance for their child.\r\n\r\nFrom Friday 20 March, schools, colleges and early years settings have been closed to everyone except children of critical workers and vulnerable children, as part of the country’s ongoing response to coronavirus. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Government has set out an expectation to local authorities that even those parents whose children are eligible to attend school should not be penalised for absence at this time. \r\n\r\nA pupil’s name can only be lawfully deleted from the school admission register in accordance with the grounds prescribed in regulation 8 of the Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006 as amended. Grounds for deletion due to absence is met if the absence is unauthorised and at least twenty consecutive days, where there is no reason to believe the absence is due to sickness or any unavoidable cause, and where the school and Local Authority cannot ascertain after reasonable enquiry where the pupil is. \r\n\r\nWe deem that absence related to the coronavirus pandemic would meet the grounds prescribed. As long as the school knows where a pupil is and why they aren’t attending, there should be no risk of the pupil losing their school place. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Education",

               "details":"The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) is available to employers and individuals, including owner-managers operating under a limited company, who pay themselves a salary through a PAYE scheme. Employers can use a portal to claim for 80 per cent of the usual monthly wage costs of furloughed employees (employees on a leave of absence) up to £2,500 a month, plus the associated Employer National Insurance Contributions and minimum automatic enrolment employer pension contributions for that wage. This means owner-managers can furlough themselves and claim for 80 per cent of their usual monthly PAYE wage costs, up to £2,500 a month. More details about the CJRS are available at www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme.\r\n\r\nDividends are not covered by the CJRS. Income from dividends is a return on investment in the company, rather than wages; under current reporting mechanisms it is not possible for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to distinguish between dividends derived from an individual’s own company and dividends from other sources, and between dividends in lieu of employment income and as returns from other corporate activity.  \r\n\r\nHMRC designed the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) using information they already had, in order to make it deliverable quickly and to minimise the risk of fraud. Expanding the scope would have required HMRC to collect and verify new information. This would have taken longer to deliver and put at risk the other schemes which the Government committed to delivering in a timely way.\r\n\r\nFinally, these schemes supplement the other significant support the Government has announced. Individuals can benefit from the Government’s relaxation of the earnings rules (known as the Minimum Income Floor) in Universal Credit. Further support for UK businesses includes the Bounce Back Loans Scheme for small businesses, the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and the deferral of tax payments. More information about the full range of business support measures is available at www.gov.uk/government/collections/financial-support-for-businesses-during-coronavirus-covid-19\r\n\r\nHM Treasury\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

It is a legal requirement for all owners to microchip their dogs, and to enter the details onto a database. Since compulsory microchipping for dogs came into force in 2016, we have seen a clear drop in the number of stray dogs on the streets and an increase in the number of lost or stolen pets reunited with their owners.\r\n\r\nBritish Veterinary Association (BVA) best practice is that vets should scan dogs on first presentation at their practice, and at other regular intervals including prior to euthanasia, where euthanasia is deemed the appropriate course of action by the veterinary expert. BVA’s website sets out their position on scanning:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bva.co.uk/News-campaigns-and-policy/Policy/Companion-animals/Microchipping/\r\n\r\nThe guidance includes advice on what a vet should do if the details of the person presenting the dog are different to what is recorded on the database, and what to do when stray or lost animals are brought to the practice by checking the microchipping databases in order to reunite the animal with their owner.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Government considers that advice from BVA and RCVS provides veterinary professionals with helpful guidance on conducting appropriate scanning, the Government is considering proposals for the compulsory scanning of dogs before euthanasia by vets as part of the ongoing Post Implementation Review of The Microchipping of Dogs (England) Regulations 2015.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

Pupils will also be taught what a stereotype is, and how stereotypes can be unfair, negative or destructive. This will be reinforced at secondary school when pupils will also learn about legal rights and responsibilities regarding equality (particularly with reference to the protected characteristics as defined in the Equality Act 2010) and that everyone is unique and equal.\r\n\r\nSchools can also teach about racism in Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) Education and Citizenship Education where pupils can develop their understanding of the diverse national, regional, religious and ethnic identities in the United Kingdom and the need for mutual respect and understanding. There is also flexibility within the history curriculum for teachers to teach about Black and minority ethnic history across the spectrum of themes and eras, to support an understanding of the active role Black and minority ethnic people have played in history.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education\r\n",

               "details":"The Government takes the issue surrounding the importation of pets very seriously and continues to ensure that the illegal import of puppies is stopped and that puppies brought into the UK through legal means receive a high standard of care. \r\n\r\nThe rules concerning the commercial transportation of animals are set out in Council Regulation (EC) 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport and in domestic legislation, The Welfare of Animals (Transport) (England) Order 2006 (WATEO). The EU legislation aims to protect the welfare of animals during transportation and applies to animals transported in connection with an economic activity. \r\n\r\nUnder article 4 of The Welfare of Animals (Transport) (England) Order 2006, there are some general provisions for the protection of all animals during transport. It is an offence to transport animals, including people transporting dogs, in a way that will cause injury or unnecessary suffering. Animals must be transported in a means of transport which takes in to consideration the conditions required for the animals such as space, ventilation, temperature, security, liquid and oxygen needed.\r\n\r\nThe primary responsibility for the enforcement of the transport legislation rests with Local Authorities. Local Authorities carry out routine welfare checks on animals and their means of transport and will take appropriate enforcement measures up to and including prosecution if required.\r\n\r\nOur policy is to ensure, therefore, full application of existing EU rules on our territory during the Transition Period, and to encourage other member states to do the same. The end of the Transition Period will open up numerous opportunities for us to further strengthen animal welfare standards in the UK. \r\n\r\nThe government also continues to raise awareness regarding the improper selling of pets by deceitful sellers through our ‘Petfished’ campaign which seeks to educate prospective pet buyers on common tricks and tactics used by deceitful sellers which may result in the purchase of a mistreated or unwell pet. The campaign urges buyers to mitigate risks, for example by buying from trusted sellers such as those under the Kennel Club’s Assured Breeder scheme, viewing puppies with their mothers and siblings, asking questions of the seller and following the Animal Welfare Foundation and RSPCA Puppy Contract to ensure that puppies are in good health when purchased.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n",

               "details":"We are grateful for the amazing contribution that migrant workers within the NHS are playing at the current time, and recognise their commitment and dedication to keep vital services running and save lives.\r\n\r\nWe have made provision for doctors, nurses and paramedics working for the NHS to automatically have their visas extended by one year if it is due to expire before 1 October 2020. The extension is free and they do not have to pay the normal immigration health surcharge. Family members will also have their visa extended. We are contacting NHS employers to identify staff eligible for this extension: the staff do not need to apply. We keep all of our policies under review and are continuing to consider how we can best support the NHS and its staff.\r\n\r\nAny migrant working in the NHS on a route which leads to settlement can apply to become a permanent resident in the UK after 5 years. Doctors and nurses, and those in other allied health professions which are on the UK Shortage Occupation List, are also exempt from having to meet the normal earnings thresholds for becoming a permanent resident in this way.\r\n\r\nTo become a British citizen you must meet a number of statutory criteria. These are set out in the British Nationality Act (1981). You must have lived here for a minimum number of years and become a permanent resident. These criteria are designed to ensure an applicant for citizenship has a strong connection to the UK and intends to remain here. Applicants must also satisfy a good character requirement and show they have sufficient knowledge of English language and of life in the UK.  Citizenship cannot be granted on a discretionary basis. \r\n\r\nWe believe it is fair that all those who want to become British citizens should meet the same core requirements, and for citizenship to be awarded on a consistent basis. It is also an approach which recognises the valuable contributions all migrants make to the UK, not only those working within the NHS.\r\n\r\nA number of countries do not allow their citizens to hold dual nationality, and can penalise people for doing so, hence granting British citizenship automatically could cause unintended issues for them.  This underlines the benefit of an applicant-led approach to citizenship.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are not currently looking at amending the citizenship requirements or introducing an automatic grant of it, we hope our NHS workers from across the globe will stay and make their lives in the UK they contribute so much to.\r\n\r\nHome Office\r\n",

               "summary":"The Royal Charter maintains the licence fee funding model until 2027. The government will look at the licence fee funding model in advance of the next Charter.",
               "details":"The licence fee is payment for a licence to watch or receive television programmes.The government is clear that the licence fee remains a licence to watch or receive television programmes, and is not a fee for BBC services. It is payable regardless of whether the licence holder ever watches the BBC. Licence fee revenue is not just used to fund the BBC, it is also used for other strategic public service objectives including S4C (the Welsh- language broadcaster). \r\n\r\nThe Royal Charter is the constitutional basis of the BBC which guarantees the BBC’s independence and provides the framework for how the BBC is governed and funded. It sets the BBC’s Mission which is ‘to act in the public interest, serving all audiences through the provision of impartial, high-quality and distinctive output and services which inform, educate and entertain’. It also sets the Public Purposes which include a duty to provide impartial news and information to help people understand and engage with the world around them and to show the most creative, highest quality and distinctive output and services. \r\n\r\nOne of the BBC's public purposes is ‘to reflect the United Kingdom, its culture and values to the world’ which the BBC does partly through the World Service - an international news service available on radio, television and online which provides impartial news reports and analysis in English and 40 other languages. The government strongly supports the BBC’s mission to bring high quality and impartial news to global audiences in some of the most remote places in the world, particularly where free speech is limited. \r\n\r\nThe licence fee funding model was considered as part of Charter Review which is the regular process for the government to review all aspects of the BBC. The BBC Charter Review consultation in 2015-16 received over 192,000 responses and found the majority of the public do not want to see a change in the way that the BBC is funded: 60% thought the current licence fee model did not need to be changed. As a result, the government committed to maintain the current model. It will be reconsidered again ahead of the next Charter Review, which is set to be completed by 2027. \r\n\r\nHowever, the government believes that it is right to look again at whether the criminal sanction remains appropriate for TV licence fee evasion, given ongoing concerns that the criminal sanction is unfair and disproportionate. On 5 February the government launched a consultation on whether TV licence evasion should be decriminalised. This consultation closed on 1 April 2020 and received over 150,000 responses. The government is considering the submissions and we will respond in due course. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the government has recently announced the introduction of a new payment plan for the TV licence, known as the Simple Payment Plan, from 1 April 2020. The Simple Payment Plan is a new, flexible payment instalment scheme that allows customers to pay in equal fortnightly or monthly instalments throughout the year, and is available to certain customers who currently struggle to pay the TV licence fee. The government will consider whether this payment plan may be extended further to increase flexibility and convenience for all licence fee payers. \r\n\r\nThe government is committed to ensuring that the BBC and all public service broadcasters adapt to a fast changing market, and keeping them at the heart of our world class TV sector. This work will begin well in advance of the next Charter and will include looking at the licence fee funding model. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport",

               "summary":"The Government recognises the devastating effects of motor neurone disease.  It is a key priority to provide access to the most effective and innovative medicines and treatments for NHS patients.",
               "details":"We are very sorry to learn about anyone who has been diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND). We recognise the immense challenges faced by those who are suffering with this truly devastating and incurable disease. \r\n\r\nThe Government understands how important it is for patients to have access to the most effective medicines and treatments. We are making the NHS one of the most pro-innovation healthcare systems in the world. The NHS Long-Term Plan and the Life Sciences Sector Deals set out a clear vision of a health system which prioritises innovation and delivers faster patient access to life-changing products.  The Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC), brings together the leaders from Government, the NHS and industry to tackle the barriers to the development and adoption of innovation in the UK. \r\n\r\nAll medicinal products are required to have a marketing authorisation (a licence) before they can be put on the market and given to patients outside of a regulated clinical trial.  Licences are given based on a positive benefit/risk assessment by a regulatory authority considering the results of animal studies and data from clinical trials which are designed to show efficacy and safety in humans.  \r\n\r\nTo run a clinical trial, a company will make an application to a regulatory authority (in the UK this is the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency), and a research ethics committee, to ensure the clinical trials are conducted appropriately.  The company that manufactures NurOwn can choose where to conduct their clinical trials and in this case the company has not conducted one in the UK.\r\n\r\nThere are various schemes by which UK patients may be able to access medicines before they are licensed. The early access to medicines scheme (EAMS) aims to give patients with life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions access to medicines that do not yet have a marketing authorisation.  Companies can choose whether to participate in the scheme, which runs in parallel with the normal licensing procedure. To date no EAMS application has been received by the manufacturer of NurOwn. UK patients may also be able to get access to unlicensed medicinal products which have been specially manufactured or imported to the order of a doctor for the treatment of individual patients.  UK legislation provides an exemption from the need for a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product which is supplied in response to an order from a doctor and is intended for use by a patient for whose treatment that person is directly responsible for.\r\n\r\nIt is important that we have a system in place for making evidence-based decisions on whether new medicines should be routinely funded by the NHS. In England the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), makes evidence-based recommendations for the NHS on whether new licensed medicines represent a clinical and cost-effective use of resources. Where NICE recommends a medicine, NHS commissioners are legally required to make routine funding available so that clinicians can offer it to their patients.  As NurOwn is not yet licensed in this country NICE is not in a position to appraise this drug.\r\n\r\nMore widely we are investing over £1bn per year through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), to fund research, and to provide the skills and facilities to enable high quality research in our health and care system. The NIHR provides the best possible environment for collaboration between the life sciences industry, charities, academia and the NHS. It supports, facilitates and enables life sciences industry collaborative and contract research, across the translational pathway from early translational (experimental medicine) research, through clinical research, to applied health research, including generation of high-quality evidence to support development and licencing of new medicines in the UK and elsewhere. \r\n \r\nWith regard to the drug inclisiran, (a new cholesterol lowering drug), in January 2020 we announced the innovative population health collaboration with Novartis. This is a world-leading example of the UK’s clinical trial innovation and technical expertise. It includes supporting a clinical trial of inclisiran, guiding the way to implementation of a new approach to care so that more people are protected against cardiovascular disease, and laying the foundations for more efficient manufacturing of new drugs. While the UK has always been open to collaborations with industry on innovative medicines that would benefit the UK population, any medicine would be subject MHRA and NICE approval processes. In line with this, inclisiran is completely subject to MHRA and NICE approval and assessment, and to the same standard of approval as any other medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care",

               "details":"Public Health England’s (PHE) Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards (CRCE) takes the lead on public health matters associated with radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, or radio waves, used in telecommunications.\r\n\r\nCentral to PHE advice is that exposure to radio waves should comply with the guidelines published by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). In compliance with PHE advice, mobile network operators have committed to follow the ICNIRP guidelines.  Therefore we have no plans to hold an investigation. \r\n\r\nICNIRP is an independent organisation which is formally recognised by the World Health Organization. It issues guidelines on human exposure to EMF, based upon the consensus view of a large amount of research carried out over many years. This includes the frequencies used by 5G and all other mobile / wireless technologies. \r\n\r\nICNIRP guidelines apply up to 300 GHz, well beyond the maximum (a few tens of GHz) frequencies under discussion for 5G.\r\n\r\nSome 5G technology will use similar frequencies to existing communications systems. Other 5G technology will work at higher frequencies, where the main change would be less penetration of radio waves through materials. \r\n\r\nPHE updated its guidance, published in October 2019, in respect of 5G and summarised its guidance as follows:    \r\n\r\n“It is possible that there may be a small increase in overall exposure to radio waves when 5G is added to an existing network or in a new area. However, the overall exposure is expected to remain low relative to the guidelines and, as such, there should be no consequences for public health.” \r\n\r\nOfcom undertakes measurements to confirm that transmitter base stations do not exceed\r\nthe limits set out in the ICNIRP guidelines. Over the last few months, Ofcom has measured\r\n5G sites in 10 UK towns and cities and in all cases, the levels recorded are a small fraction\r\nof those in the ICNIRP guidelines.\r\n\r\nThe maximum measured at any mobile site was approximately 1.5% of those levels –\r\nincluding signals from other mobile technologies such as 3G and 4G. The highest level from\r\n5G signals specifically was 0.039% of the maximum set out in the guidelines.\r\n\r\nA summary of PHE advice on 5G can be accessed in the following links: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/5g-technologies-radio-waves-and-health/5g-technologies-radio-waves-and-health\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mobile-phone-base-stations-radio-waves-and-health/mobile-phone-base-stations-radio-waves-and-health \r\n\r\nICNIRP’s guidance on 5G can be found here:\r\nhttps://www.icnirp.org/en/applications/5g/5g.html\r\n\r\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media \u0026 Sport",

               "details":"The UK’s longstanding position on the Middle East Peace Process is clear: we support a negotiated settlement leading to a safe and secure Israel living alongside a viable and sovereign Palestinian state; based on 1967 borders with agreed land swaps, Jerusalem as the shared capital of both states, and a just, fair, agreed and realistic settlement for refugees. \r\n\r\nThe UK will recognise a Palestinian state at a time when it best serves the objective of peace. Bilateral recognition in itself cannot end the occupation. Without a negotiated settlement the occupation and the problems that come with it will continue.\r\n\r\nWe are deeply concerned by reports that the new Israeli government coalition has reached an agreement which may pave the way for annexation of parts of the West Bank. Any unilateral moves towards annexation of parts of the West Bank by Israel would be damaging to efforts to restart peace negotiations and contrary to international law. \r\n\r\nWe continue to urge Israel not to take steps towards annexation. The Prime Minister urged Israel not to proceed in an article in Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth on 1 July. The Prime Minister has also conveyed the UK’s opposition to unilateral annexation to Prime Minister Netanyahu on multiple occasions, including in a phone call in February and a letter in June. The Foreign Secretary reiterated this message in his introductory calls with Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Gantz on 20 May and Foreign Minister Ashkenazi on 2 June. The Minister for the Middle East and North Africa also did so at the UN Security Council on 24 June. \r\n\r\nWe continue to work closely with international partners strongly advocating a two-state solution and encouraging a return to meaningful negotiations. The Foreign Secretary did so most recently in a meeting with the French Foreign Minister Le Drian on 29 June, and the German Foreign Minister Maas on 19 June. He has discussed efforts to pursue a negotiated solution with the Egyptian Foreign Minister Shoukry and Jordanian Foreign Minister Safadi. \r\n\r\nThe Palestinian Authority (PA) has made important progress on state-building which has been recognised by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The UK also believes that the PA has the capability to run an effective, inclusive, accountable state. That is why it is so important that the PA now returns to Gaza to ensure that good governance is extended throughout the territory which will become a Palestinian state. \r\n\r\nThe UK is a leading donor to the Palestinian Authority and a strong supporter of its state-building efforts. We help build the capacity of a future Palestinian state to ensure that it can meet the needs of its people and act as a partner for peace with Israel. UK Aid to the PA supports the provision of education and health services in the West Bank. In 2018/19 UK support helped pay the salaries of 37,600 health and education workers. This enabled 26,000 Palestinians to get an education and delivered 3,300 MMR immunisations and 111,000 medical consultations. In 2019/2020, we will provide around £16m in humanitarian assistance to Gaza.  This is supporting the health system, including improved trauma care, and contributing to emergency food aid for around 1.2 million vulnerable people.\r\n\r\nEvery Israeli and Palestinian has the right to live in peace and security. A just and lasting resolution that ends the occupation and delivers peace for both Israelis and Palestinians is long overdue. The focus now must be finding a way back to negotiations. We continue to encourage both sides to return to the negotiating table and resume dialogue. \r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office",

               "details":"The Government is sympathetic to the emotional trauma which the theft of a much-loved pet can cause. All reported crimes should be taken seriously, investigated and, where appropriate, taken through the courts and met with tough sentences. The theft of a pet is already a criminal offence under the Theft Act 1968 and the maximum penalty is seven years’ imprisonment and so there is no need to introduce a separate offence.\r\n\r\nSentencing is entirely a matter for our independent courts and must take into account the circumstances of each case. When deciding on an appropriate sentence, the courts consider any aggravating and mitigating factors, in line with sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council. In February 2016 the Sentencing Council updated its guidelines in relation to sentencing for theft offences. The guidelines take account of the emotional distress, and therefore harm, that theft of personal items such as a pet can have on the victim, and accordingly recommends higher penalties for such offences.\r\n\r\nSince 6 April 2016, all dogs in England and Wales must be microchipped and registered on an approved database by the time they are eight weeks’ old. Since we made microchipping compulsory, the number of dogs microchipped has gone up from around 58% of all dogs in 2013 to over 90% of all dogs. This means that about 8.5 million dogs in the United Kingdom are microchipped. We also advise cat owners to get their cat microchipped and it was a manifesto commitment to introduce compulsory microchipping for cats. As part of this commitment we recently completed a Call for Evidence on cat microchipping which attracted over 3,000 responses. We are in the process of analysing the responses and will publish a summary of the responses together with a way forward in due course.\r\n\r\nOwners should report the theft of their dog or cat to the database on which the animal’s microchip is registered, along with the corresponding crime reference number. There is a much better chance that animals will be returned to their owners if they are microchipped and their records kept up to date. Owners can take certain precautions to deter the theft of their dog, such as never letting their pet out of sight when it is being exercised; varying their routines when walking their dogs and not leaving their dog unattended when in public. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n",

               "details":"The Government has taken unprecedented steps to keep people in work, protect people’s incomes, and support businesses. Its economic response is one of the most generous and comprehensive in the world, with the latest statistics highlighting how this support is protecting jobs and helping individuals across all four nations of UK.\r\n                                                            \r\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) is helping firms keep millions of people in employment. As of midnight on 14 June, the CJRS has so far helped 1.1 million employers across the UK furlough 9.1 million jobs. \r\n\r\nThe Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) also helps those adversely affected by COVID-19. As of midnight on 14 June, 2.6 million individuals have claimed grants worth £7.6 billion in total. \r\n\r\nThe Government needed to deliver support at incredible speed, and it prioritised creating schemes that could help as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. The Government worked with stakeholders and carefully considered the case for changing the schemes, taking action where it can. For example, the eligibility cut-off date for the CJRS was extended from 28 February to 19 March to allow more than 200,000 employees to be furloughed. This change made the scheme more generous while keeping the substantial fraud risks under control. \r\n\r\nIn other areas, it has not been possible to extend the schemes in other ways because of design and operational complexity, which would have taken much longer to implement, but this does not mean these groups have been forgotten or that no support is available for those who are not eligible through the CJRS and SEISS. These schemes continue to be just two elements of an enormous package of support for individuals and businesses. This package includes Bounce Back loans, tax deferrals, rental support, increased levels of Universal Credit, mortgage holidays, and other business support grants. These measures will support millions of families, businesses and individuals to get through this and emerge on the other side both stronger and more united.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury",

               "details":"The 25 Year Environment Plan sets out the Government’s ambition for nature recovery, in particular, our threatened and iconic species. Whilst the reasons for the decline in numbers of this native species are complex, we recognise the role that habitat loss plays. \r\n\r\nHedgehogs are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 from being killed using prohibited methods such as crossbows, traps and snares. However, further protection of hedgehogs will not support the species and may have unintended consequences because:\r\n \r\n•\twe have no evidence that intentionally killing, taking or injuring hedgehogs is currently an issue; \r\n\r\n•\tprotecting such a generalist habitat from destruction or disturbance could have the unintended consequence of making it a criminal offence to tend gardens and maintain land for other purposes; and \r\n\r\n•\tit may have the unintended consequence of deterring the maintenance and creation of habitat for hedgehogs if there will be a restriction on land use as a result. \r\n \r\nWe recognise that habitat loss is one of the main threats to the hedgehog population. Under our 25 Year Environment Plan, we are committed to creating or restoring 500,000 hectares of wildlife-rich habitat to provide benefits for species such as the hedgehog. Agri-environment schemes such as Countryside Stewardship provide funding to restore, extend and link important habitats and boost food resources for our native species. \r\n\r\nThe Department commends the work, including research, by the British Hedgehog Preservation Society and the People’s Trust for Endangered Species, such as their Conservation Strategy for Hedgehogs. Additionally, we have published advice on how to help hedgehogs through the creation of hedgehog havens and making gardens as welcoming as possible. This can be accessed at: www.gov.uk/government/news/five-simple-steps-to-transform-gardens-in-to-hedgehog-havens\r\n\r\nThe revised National Planning Policy Framework sets out the Government’s policy on planning and states that the planning system should contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by minimising impacts on, and providing net gains for biodiversity, including by establishing coherent ecological networks.

The Ministry of Justice is equally determined to protect those who live and work in prisons from harm and ensure the stability of our jails.  \r\n\r\nPublic Health England has advised that without action, coronavirus could spread rapidly in prisons due to the close proximity in which prisoners live, overwhelming local NHS services and putting the lives of prisoners, staff and people outside the prison system at risk. It is for these reasons, and in response to the current unprecedented emergency, that on Saturday 4 April, the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice announced that carefully risk-assessed prisoners, who are already within two months of their release date will be temporarily released from prison.  \r\n\r\nPrisoners who pass the criteria for release will be subject to strict conditions, and will be electronically monitored, including with GPS tags, to enforce the requirement to stay at home. They can be immediately recalled to prison for breaching these conditions or committing further offences. The releases will be phased over time but can start from the week commencing 6 April.\r\n \r\nThe Government has also previously announced that pregnant women in custody who do not pose a high risk of harm to the public will be temporarily released from prison to protect them and their unborn children from coronavirus. Prisoners in Mother and Baby Units meeting the same risk assessment will also be released with their children. \r\n \r\nPublic protection is paramount, and therefore no high-risk offenders, including those convicted of violent or sexual offences, anyone of national security concern or a danger to children, will be considered for release, nor any prisoners who have not served at least half of their custodial term. Additionally, no offenders convicted of COVID-19 related offences, including coughing at emergency workers or stealing personal protective equipment, will be eligible. No prisoner would be released if they have symptoms of coronavirus or without housing and health support being in place.\r\n \r\nWe do not take this decision, or our duty of care to prisoners and staff, lightly. Alongside this we are also working to identify publicly owned sites that could be used to house temporary prison accommodation to ease pressure on the permanent estate, and allow us to further separate prisoners and reduce the spread of the virus. We are also working with the judiciary to expedite sentencing hearings for those on remand to reduce the numbers being held in custody. \r\n\r\nThere will be some vulnerable prisoners who will not be suitable for release owing to the risk they pose to the public, and to protect them we have provided guidance to prisons on measures to take to shield vulnerable people.  This includes the creation of shielding units, which are a specific part of a prison designated to house those required to socially shield themselves. \r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice.",
