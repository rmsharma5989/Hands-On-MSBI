1	System Controlled parallel	we will keep concurrentExecution setting by default and run the processing without giving precedence constraints, will see how many tasks system find to run in parallel by default, and time take to complete	2020-08-09 20:41:35.297	2020-08-09 20:42:34.223	00:00:59
2	System Controlled sequental	we will keep concurrentExecution setting by default and provide the precedence constraints to run task in sequence, will see how much time it will take to complete in sequental. 	2020-08-09 20:57:16.273	2020-08-09 20:58:36.753	00:01:20
3	User Controlled parallel	we will keep concurrentExecution setting to 10 to make system to run 10 processes parallel and see how much time it take.	2020-08-09 20:59:43.733	2020-08-09 21:00:18.423	00:00:35
4	User Controlled sequental	we will keep concurrentExecution setting to 1, and will not connect the precedence consstraints, and will see how much time it will take to complete	2020-08-09 21:01:16.880	2020-08-09 21:02:37.313	00:01:21
